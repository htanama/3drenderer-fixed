3D Graphics Programming from Scratch. Required Older GCC Compiler  &lt; GCC-10  


The GCC compiler started to become significantly more strict with the release of GCC 10 in 2020. 
While each new version of GCC introduces stricter checks and better compliance with C++ standards, GCC 10 marked a major leap in this regard.

I compiled the source code using GCC-9.3.0 and it is compiling, Newer GCC compiler will break the compilation and texture rendering will be an issue. 
I cannot render red brick texture compiling using GCC 12 and newer.
